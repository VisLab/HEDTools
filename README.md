# HedTools
Hierarchical Event Descriptor tools - pointer


The original HedTools repository contained tools to create, parse, and validate Hierarchical Event Descriptor strings. Tools were written in MATLAB, Python, and Java.  The original repository is deprecated and can be found at https://github.com/VisLab/HedToolsArchived.

The code has been moved to an open source organization on github:   https://github.com/hed-standard.  It has been split into three code repositories:
 -  python:  https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-python  
 -  matlab:  https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-matlab
 -  java:    https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-java
 
 
 The current version of the HED schema can be found in the hedxml directory in the https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-specification repository.
